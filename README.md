# mta-dataanalysis

This project was learning task in wrangling with data of turnsite provided publicly by MTA. (Can be found here http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html)

The Util method old_format_to_new clears the MTA formate of 8 Entry Exit data in one row to 1 entry exit data per row. 

The ca_station.csv maps a C/A to a station. The following is an example.

`df2['station'] = df2['C/A'].apply(lambda x: ca_station_map[x] if x in ca_station_map.index else 'UNDEF' + x`

Both the problems were resolved after 10/18/14. So for later files the processing is faster because no pre-processing is required.

I solved the following problems for practice. 

## Data analysis
1) Which station has the most number of units as of today?
2) What is the total number of entries & exits across the subway system for August 1, 2013?
3) Letâ€™s define the busy-ness as sum of entry & exit count. What station was the busiest on August 1, 2013? What turnstile was the busiest on that date?
4) What stations have seen the most usage growth/decline in 2013?
5) What dates in 2013 are the least busy? Could you identify days in 2013 on which stations were not operating at full capacity or closed entirely?

## Visualization
1) Plot the daily row counts for data files in Q3 2013.
2) Plot the daily total number of entries & exits across the system for Q3 2013.
3) Plot the mean and standard deviation of the daily total number of entries & exits for each month in Q3 2013 for station 34 ST-PENN STA.
4) Plot 25/50/75 percentile of the daily total number of entries & exits for each month in Q3 2013 for station 34 ST-PENN STA.
5) Plot the daily number of closed stations and number of stations that were not operating at full capacity in Q3 2013.

More ideas on what can be done with it are welcomed. Would love to implement any learning task or correlation taks.
